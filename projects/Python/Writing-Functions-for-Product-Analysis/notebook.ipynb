    "<p>Have you ever started your data analysis and ended up with repetitive code? Our colleague Brenda who works as a Product Analyst, has found herself in this situation and has asked us for some help. She's written a script to pull Net Promotor Score (NPS) data from various sources. NPS works by asking <em>How likely is it that you would recommend our product to a friend or colleague?</em> with a rating scale of 0 to 10. Brenda has set up this NPS survey in various ways, including emails and pop-ups on the mobile app and website. To compile the data from the different sources, she's written the following code:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code class=\"py language-py\"># Read the NPS email responses into a DataFrame\n",
    "email = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/2020Q4_nps_email.csv\")\n",

    "email['source'] = 'email'\n",

    "<p>This code works, but it violates the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) programming principle. Brenda repeats the same code for email, mobile, and web, except with different variable names and file names. While it's often quicker to copy and paste, it makes it easier to introduce errors. For example, if you need to edit one of those lines, you have to do it in multiple places. Enter functions! Repeated code is a sign that we need functions. Let's write a function for Brenda.</p>"

That way, we can define a dictionary with as many NPS files as we have and run it through <code>combine_nps_csvs()</code>.

It would be great to have this as a column in our NPS DataFrames, similar to the <code>source</code> column we added. Since we've modularized our code with functions, all we need to do is edit our <code>convert_cvs_to_df()</code> function and nest <code>categorize_nps()</code> into it. However, the way we'll nest <code>categorize_nps()</code> will be different than previous times. The <code>pandas</code> library has a handy function called <code>apply()</code>, which lets us apply a function to each column or row of a DataFrame. </p>"

    "## 7. Breaking down NPS by source\n",
    "<p>Is it good to have an NPS score around 10? The worst NPS score you can get is -100 when all respondents are detractors, and the best is 100 when all respondents are promoters. Depending on the industry of your service or product, average NPS scores vary a lot. However, a negative score is a bad sign because it means you have more unhappy customers than happy customers. Typically, a score over 50 is considered excellent, and above 75 is considered best in class.</p>\n",
    "<p>Although our score is above 0, it's still on the lower end of the spectrum. The product team concludes that majorly increasing NPS across our customer base is a priority. Luckily, we have this NPS data that we can analyze more so we can find data-driven solutions. A good start would be breaking down the NPS score by the source type. For instance, if people are rating lower on the web than mobile, that's some evidence we need to improve the browser experience.</p>"

    "## 8. Adding docstrings\n",
    "<p>Interesting! The mobile responses have an NPS score of about -15, which is noticeably lower than the other two sources. There are few ways we could continue our analysis from here. We could use the column <code>user_id</code> to reach out to users who rated poorly on the mobile app for user interviews. We could also breakdown NPS by source and date to see if there was a date where NPS started clearly decreasing - perhaps the same time there was a bug or feature realeased. With the functions we created, Brenda is in a good place to continue this work!</p>\n",
    "<p>The last thing we'll discuss is docstrings. In Task 1, 2, 4 and 5, we included docstrings for <code>convert_csv_to_df()</code>, <code>check_csv()</code>, and <code>categorize_nps()</code>. However, we should include docstrings for all the functions we write so that others can better re-use and maintain our code. Docstrings tell readers what a function does, its arguments, its return value(s) if any, and any other useful information you want to include, like error handling. There are several standards for writing docstrings in Python, including: <a href=\"https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html\">Numpydoc</a>, <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html\">Google-style</a> (chosen style in this notebook), and <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/\">reStructuredText</a>.</p>\n",
    "<p>To make sure Brenda and other colleagues can follow our work, we are going to add docstrings to the remaining undocumented functions: <code>combine_nps_csvs()</code>, <code>calculate_nps()</code>, and <code>calculate_nps_by_source</code>. It's up to you how you want to write the docstrings - we'll only check that a docstring exists for each of these functions. </p>"
