<p>Back in the late 80's I walked into the Ritz in the middle of the Laughing Hyenas and watched in disbelief while singer John Brannon churned out one hell of a gutteral yowl for the duration of a whole set in almost inhuman fashion.

Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down.

<p>Back in the late 80's I walked into the Ritz in the middle of the Laughing Hyenas and watched in disbelief while singer John Brannon churned out one hell of a gutteral yowl for the duration of a whole set in almost inhuman fashion.

Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down.

<p>Back in the late 80's I walked into the Ritz in the middle of the Laughing Hyenas and watched in disbelief while singer John Brannon churned out one hell of a gutteral yowl for the duration of a whole set in almost inhuman fashion.

Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down.

For over a half hour the group lurched through total classics: ""Thing With a Hook"", ""Nicole Told Me"", ""I'll Change My Style"" all the way through the burning impromptu finale of the 13th Floor Elevators' ""You're Gonna Miss Me"". What made the set extra special (besides Jad's spastic strumming on his red mini-electric axe and David's full on dance invocations of Timothy Carey ala <em>World's Greatest Sinner</em>) was the presence of a classic era lineup that included Mark Jickling, John Moreman, Rick and John Dreyfuss and extra 2nd sax from guest Ira Kaplan. Pure joy. I will say though, I was bummed a bit afterwards when Ira showed me the setlist and the tunes that got cut due to time constraints, but happy to say I caught a bunch of them the next day at Half Jap's Waterloo Records in-store. More SXSW archives, photos, and video to come, but let's drop a pile of MP3s right off the bat from the Band Who Would Be King (sorry though, we have to cut the Roky cover!).

It later went through a great many changes in form and arrangement, from various live band versions to the final recorded version on Angels of Light - Everything is Good Here/Please Come Home (even that version was rerecorded and further transformed during those sessions). Of all of them, I now like this version the best. Oh well, no going back…</p>

lyrics
You never know just how long you have 
Before you go 
Away 

So take back life; hide it from view 
It will only be us and 
the wind 

Times are down but we’re ok 
Lines are down but we’re ok 
We’re ok. 

You never know just how many times 
You get to say 
Hello 

Come out with me take the f-train 
Into the night 
We’ll disappear 

Times are down but we’re ok 
Lines are down but we’re ok 
We’re ok. 

When you send light into the world 
It scatters and reflects 
But it never dies",2302,,Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States,1557,,3,,[],ok
